# Chartsutil

This project is designed to augment the functionality of the rancher [charts-build-script](https://github.com/rancher/charts-build-scripts) by adding functionality that aids in the development of charts, but are not aiding in the specific build process and therefore don't quite fit the scoping of that tool.

## Building

```
make build
```

## Running

```
bin/chartsutil --help
```
